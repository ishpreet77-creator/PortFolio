                                <p>I entered the mobile development field straight from university with my degree being
                                    in Computer Science. Over the past 2. In the last 5 years, I have been specializing
                                    myself in iOS development and recently gaining the knowledge in Flutter Development
                                    and a bit of Reactnative working on different app development including Interactive
                                    Bible, Shoping, Event, Dating apps and efficient shopping platforms. Every one of
                                    them has been an eye opener and has revived the determination of providing quality
                                    service.</p>

                                <p>My forte is iOS development, but I am also well versed in some of the hybrid app
                                    technologies like React Native and flutter but primarily work in Swift. Key
                                    competencies which I possess are: interface design, APIs implementation, and
                                    improving the application’s performance. This makes me embrace the thinking of the
                                    introduction of new technologies into my projects to make them state of the arts.

                                    considered as innovative. Two of the major fields that I am keen on focusing on
                                    while utilizing AI is the incorporation of the technology in Apps and creating
                                    better experiences in the applications. Shall we facilitate ourselves and build
                                    something great hand in hand?</p>
